# nfs_monitoring
The script should monitor specific mount points on a Solaris or Linux machine. 
In case the 'specified' mount point is "stale" or "not responding" the script executes a sequence of commands to solve the problem automatically.

Road Map 
Status October 2016: Script will be extended to seperate between machines who use autofs and which doesn't.
